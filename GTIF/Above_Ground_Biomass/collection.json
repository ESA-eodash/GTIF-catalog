  "description": "#### TIPS ON USING THIS TOOL\nUse this tool to identify areas with higher or lower biomass, or more generally characterised by a specific range of biomass values.\n\n#### WHY THIS DATA\nHumans have exploited forest biomass as a material and energy source for millennia, but population growth and increasing demand for resources have diminished the extent and condition of forests, including the amount of carbon they store and exchange with the atmosphere.\nThe Global Climate Observing System considers above-ground biomass (AGB) an Essential Climate Variable due to its functions as both a source of atmospheric CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) when forest is lost under Land Use Change or by degradation, and as a sink for CO2 due to forest growth.\nInformation on forest biomass can also play a much wider role in understanding and predicting climate, for example in model initialisation, model testing, estimation of carbon turnover, inferring the forest disturbance regime, and data assimilation in carbon cycle and climate models.\n\n**Developed with**  \n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/gtif-logos/forestCarbon_row.png)\n",
